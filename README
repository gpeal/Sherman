Design Competition

This is the source code for team "One to One's" robot for Northwestern University's Design Competition.
We are using Microchip's 32 bit microcontroller, along with standard LCDs and other components.
Feel free to browse and take code as you please. We try to make sure our code follows good coding practices and is well commented.
